            <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
            <p> Heyo! My name's Ryder Franklin - though I tend to use the username rydooper on social media platforms!
              <br> I currently work for Nottingham Trent University's Architecture and Built Environment department as a Research Assistant on a project working with Network Rail and BCU to create a digital examination environment.
            </p>
            <p>I have extensive experience with Python, Web Languages (HTML, CSS, nodeJS and EJS), and Azure deployment technologies within a professional environment. Additionally, I've helped created documentation and done extensive testing of our project. This was mostly manual testing, not automated, though this is an area I'm interesting in learning more about. </p>
            <p> Within my personal projects, I'm a big fan of webscraping and web-development. I also enjoy using Artificial Intelligence and machine
              learning to make life just that <i>bit</i> easier. For a while, I've been working on a personal assistant that I call "Artie" which uses response-based aiml to perform various tasks on the pc without needing to use the mouse or keyboard. There's still a lot of work to be done and this has taken a back-burner lately.
              <br> My big project at the moment, however, is a Visual Novel game using Renpy, which is a Python based game engine.
              It's fairly simplistic in terms of code but the process of the user actions' flow, storyboarding for the art and plotlines has been a unique challenge!
              <br> In my spare non-coding time, I've been learning Gaelic and Japanese, and I've been experimenting with photography too.
            </p>

            <p>More details about these projects and some of the other things I've made, along with Sources for any images or content used on here can be found via the navbar!
