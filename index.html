<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p> Howdy! I'm Ryder Franklin, a 2nd Year Computer Science student at Nottingham Trent University. <br>
    I enjoy programming in Python and HTML and I particularly like machine learning! <br>
    In my spare time, I am learning to speak Russian and I am writing a Fantasy novel!</p>
