          <subtitle>Artie</subtitle> <br>
          <div>
            <p>Artie is a personal project of mine that I've been working on since September 2021! He's a voice
              assistant in the making, built in Python.
              <br> Currently, his functionality involves a login system, use of the wikipedia API, telling the
              user a joke, and locking or shutting down the computer.
              <br> In the future, his functionality will also include: getting the weather for a given location.
              In a more vague sense, I will be implementing some machine learning so that
              Artie can retain "memories" in a more permanent manner, as well as giving him a much wider
              functionality that allows him to be used casually. <br>
              Out of all of my projects, Artie is the most long-term but has been put on the back-burner for now, as his use-case is hyper specific.

          <subtitle>Visual Novel - Insulated Hearts </subtitle>
          <div>
            <p>There's no greater wall to climb than love! Well... there is that competition in two weeks time that you accidentally signed up for.
              That wall could be pretty big too.
              <br>
              You are a new indoor rock climber at the gym and meet the eclectic regulars, who are all very happy to mingle with a new face!
            </p>
            <p>This is my most recent project and still a while in the making. Following a lot of visual novel ideas,
              this is a dating simulater, essentially, with an extended cast of queer/LGBTQ+ characters and various attempts to subvert typical tropes in these games.
              It's based around an indoor climbing competition event that is upcoming and the player character's various attempts to "get gud" in time for it,
              while also (potentially) finding someone to stand on on the podium with...
              <br> It's a very fun little project, but unfortunately, doesn't have a lot to show for it just yet.
              Though the writing and user workflow is ready, I still have a lot of art to draw and (hopefully) audio to add.

          <subtitle>Final Year Project - BBC Article Webscraper</subtitle>
          <div>
            <p> This project, officially titled "Artificial Intelligence: Automatic News Extraction" was for my final
              year project - aka my dissertation - and is open-source.
              <br> Essentially, my project uses a Selenium webscraper to get news articles from the BBC News
              website, based on a users' query. This data is then analysed and graphed using hot topic extraction.
              <br> For future development, I would have liked to increase the corpus of the project, by adding more
              websites to the webscraper and implementing further search features, along with a machine learning
              algorithm that ignores potentially "fake" or malicious news.
              <br>However, there were issues when I researched this further, as BBC and many other news sites have
              strict rules and regulations regarding "bots" and their usage on their sites, so this project remains an academic proof-of-concept.

          <subtitle>SCC Coursework </subtitle>
          <div>
            <p>This application was created for my SCC module in third year. It uses the Springboot
              framework in Java to host an Apache Tomcat 9.0 server. Using this server and a rest controller,
              I had several function calls: <i>/weather</i>, <i>/user</i>, <i>/query</i>, <i>/submit</i> and
              <i>/intent</i>.
              <br> This coursework was a particularly interesting challenge as, at the time, I didn't have
              much experience with Java and had never used or really heard of REST services.
              Although my final application had some issues (a lack of non-volatile data storage for
              example), I'm very proud of this one.

          <subtitle>Machine Learning Coursework</subtitle>
          <div>
            <p>For my machine learning module in second year, I used Stack Overflows' developers survey to predict a
              developers salary, based on the features selected.
              This project is unique in that it is based and runs on Kaggle, using Jupyter Notebook, which
              allowed me to run the CPU-intense algorithms. It is one of my favourite projects, as the data had some fascinating results.
              <br> In the end, I selected 13 features, including "Gender", "Sexuality" and "Trans" (a
              yes/no question), as these were the ones I was most curious about - were these factors impactful on a developers' salary?
              Ultimately, my model was rather successful (around 70%) and utilised clustering for prediction.
              <br> If I were to return to this project, I'd love to repeat this with more samples (Stack Overflow repeat this survey annually)
              and see how this may differ over the years - and if the increasing use of AI has impacted these results.
