                        <p> Artie is a personal project of mine that I've been working on since September 2021! He's a
                            voice
                            assistant in the making, built in Python.
                            <br> Currently, his functionality involves a login system, use of the wikipedia API, telling
                            the
                            user a joke, and locking or shutting down the computer.
                            <br> In the future, his functionality will also include: getting the weather for a given
                            location.
                            In a more vague sense, I will be implementing some machine learning so that
                            Artie can retain "memories" in a more permanent manner, as well as giving him a much wider
                            functionality that allows him to be used casually. <br>
                            Out of all of my projects, Artie is the most long-term and will be continuously updated over
                            the
                            years.

                                Design and the Built Environment.

                                In essence, I used Autodesk Forges' API to build a viewer for specified file types -
                                BIM models
                                - to display bridges for the Asset Visualiser website that is currently under
                                development,
                                in
                                partnership with Waldeck Consulting.
                                Though the project's code is obviously private, it is similar in appearance to

                            <p> This project, officially titled "Artificial Intelligence: Automatic News Extraction" was
                                for my

                                year project - aka my dissertation - and is open-source.
                                <br> Essentially, my project uses a Selenium webscraper to get news articles from the
                                BBC News
                                website, based on a users' query. This data is then analysed and graphed using hot topic
                                extraction. An example wordcloud can be found below!
                                <br> For future development, I would like to increase the corpus of the project, by
                                adding more
                                websites to the webscraper and implementing further search features, along with a
                                machine
                                learning
                                algorithm that ignores potentially "fake" or malicious news. However, there are some
                                legal
                                issues
                                with using data from the BBC's website and so it's unlikely this will ever enter a
                                production
                                environment - at least, not while using BBC News' site for the corpus.

                    <p> This application was created for my SCC module in third year. It uses the Springboot
                        framework in
                        Java
                        to host an Apache Tomcat 9.0 server. Using this server and a rest controller, I had
                        several
                        function calls: <i>/weather</i>, <i>/user</i>, <i>/query</i>, <i>/submit</i> and
                        <i>/intent</i>.
                        <br> This coursework was a particularly interesting challenge as, at the time, I didn't
                        have
                        much
                        experience with Java and had never used and barely even heard of REST services.
                        Although my final application had some issues (a lack of non-volatile data storage for
                        example), I'm
                        very proud of this one.

                        salary, based on the features I selected.
                        This project is unique in that it is based and runs on Kaggle, using Jupyter Notebook,
                        which
                        allowed
                        me to run the CPU-intense algorithms.
                        <br> In the end, I selected 13 features, including "Gender", "Sexuality" and "Trans" (a
                        yes/no
                        question), as these were the most interesting ones.
                        Ultimately, my model was rather successful (around 70%) and utilised clustering for
